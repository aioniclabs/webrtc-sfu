# Introduction

Weever Streaming is a Open Source [WebRTC SFU](../concepts/webrtc-sfu.md).

It serves for broadcasting, video conferencing, or regular video/audio/data streaming.

It's easy to deploy and scale.

You can come up with your own streaming products/platforms easily with it,
as long as you are familiar with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and web service hosting.

You can also come up with non-web products/platforms,
as long as you can run HTTP client with WebRTC capability.
